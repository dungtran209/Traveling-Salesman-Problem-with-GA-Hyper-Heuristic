# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-with-GA-Hyper-Heuristic

## Introduction
A Genetic-based Hyper-heuristics framework to optimize the parameters of Simulated Annealing Algorithm with application in Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), using Matlab

## Methodology Summary

### Individual Encoding and Initialisation
*1. Simulation Annealing (SA) Parameters*

Parameter of SA | Range
------------ | -------------
Initial temperature (𝜏0) | Between 1 and 20
Final temperature (𝜏𝑓) | Between 0.1 and 0.5
The number of neighbours to visit (𝑟𝜏) | An integer value between 10 and 500
Temperature control function (TCF) | Either option 1 or 2, which are exponential multiplicative cooling or non-monotonic scheme respectively
Cooling rate (𝛼) | Between 0.8 and 0.99
Acceptance probability function (APF) | Either function 1 or 2, which are Metropolis criterion or Barker function respectively

*2. Simulation Annealing Pseudo-code*

(1) Start with an initial feasible tour which generated by Farthest Insertion Procedure
(2) Set the best solution as the first tour in Step 1
(3) Select the initial temperature (𝜏0), the final temperature (𝜏𝑓), the temperature control function  and the cooling rate
(4) Set the current temperature (𝜏) as 𝜏0
(5) **REPEAT**
(6)    Choose the number of neighbours to visit at each temperature (𝑟𝜏)
(7)    Set the repetition counter (𝑟) as 0
(8)    **REPEAT**
(9)       Randomly generate a new neighbour set by using 2-opt and calculate Improvement Cost
(10)      Calculate the Acceptance Probability;
(11)      **IF** (Random Selected Number from 0 to 1 < APF) THEN
(12)         Update the current tour and TSP cost
(13)         **IF** (Best Cost > TSP cost) THEN replace best solution with new generated tour
(14)      Increase repetition counter (by 1)
(15)    **UNTIL** 𝑟=𝑟𝜏
(16)    Reduce 𝜏 according to the temperature reduction schedule
(17) **UNTIL** 𝜏≤𝜏𝑓

*3. Genetic Algorithm (GA) Elements*

Element | Value | Element | Value
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Population Size | 50 | Mutation Rate | 0.001
Tournament Size | 4 | Elitism | 0.1
Crossover Rate  | 0.6 | Stopping Condition | 10 minutes each
